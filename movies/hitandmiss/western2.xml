<summary>["It is 1892 in Death Valley and the yields from the Borax ore are getting so small that refining it is a losing proposition. The only thing that will save the company is a new deposit of high grade Borax, and Bill has a pouch of it that he got from a dead prospector that he buried on the road. Roper knows the value of the strike could be worth millions, but he needs Bill to find the prospectors' claim so they can record it and become rich partners. While Roper has no intention of cutting Bill in on the millions, he also has his eye on young Jean. Josie sees Roper for the scalawag that his is and it means trouble in Furnace Flat."]</summary>

That quote kicks off the first of multiple story lines, in the crime ensemble "Bubblegum & Broken Fingers." This character-driven collage of sex, violence and survival is equal parts western, gangster and love stories. We follow the journey of a mysterious silver briefcase and witness the havoc it brings each new owner. The seemingly unrelated stories continuously collide throughout for multiple plot twists.

A tiny mute hitch hiker has a day she\'ll never forget. Blix, an escapee from a federal prison, goes on a destructive rampage. Playboy Doctor Sean Steele puts his life in jeopardy when he thinks with the wrong head. FBI agent Hampton and U.S. Marshal Yamato ruthlessly compete for the same arrest. These stories of dysfunction all smash together for a ...']</summary>

However, the railroad companies and banks still consider them outlaws and will take matters into their own hands if they come across the gangs.

<summary>["When Benjie, a black man who fought in the Civil War, returns to the southern town of Ironside, his return is not exactly a welcome one. The citizens are already uptight about the color of his skin...but the fact that he fought for the Union Army and still wears his uniform is all that is needed for hatred and violence to be fanned by an ex-Confederate soldier named Colby. Benjie's one true friend turns out to be Neal McMasters, the rancher who raised Benjie and is now offering him a half-share in the McMasters land. As Benjie tries to make his new home, he helps some starving Indians and finds himself the owner of an Indian woman who eventually becomes his wife. He also uses Indians to help with the round-up. But things come to a violent turn when Kolby's hatred launches a reign of anger that brings about an unusual white-black-red triangle in the phenomenon of prejudice."]</summary>
